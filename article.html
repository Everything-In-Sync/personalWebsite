                    Some decisions announce themselves. They arrive with urgency, 
                    demanding immediate attention. But the ones that shape us most 
                    often slip by unnoticed—small choices made in ordinary moments 
                    that compound over years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think about the morning I decided to walk instead of drive. 
                    Not for any particular reason. The weather was mild. I had time. 
                    That walk became a habit, then a ritual, then a fundamental part 
                    of how I process the world.
                </p>

                <h2>The Compound Effect</h2>

                <p>
                    We overestimate the impact of single dramatic moments and 
                    underestimate the power of consistency. A conversation you 
                    almost didn't have. A book you picked up on impulse. The 
                    decision to stay five minutes longer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These aren't the stories we tell at dinner parties. They lack 
                    the narrative arc we've been trained to expect. But they're the 
                    real architecture of a life—the invisible scaffolding that holds 
                    everything else in place.
                </p>

                <h2>Attention as Choice</h2>

                <p>
                    Every moment of attention is a quiet decision. What you notice, 
                    what you ignore, what you return to again and again. These micro-
                    choices accumulate into something resembling a worldview, though 
                    it never feels like you're building anything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The writer Annie Dillard said it better: "How we spend our days 
                    is, of course, how we spend our lives." The quiet decisions are 
                    the days. The loud ones are just punctuation.
                </p>

                <h2>Learning to Notice</h2>

                <p>
                    I've started paying attention to the small choices—not to 
                    optimize them, but simply to see them. There's something 
                    clarifying about recognizing that you're always choosing, 
                    even when it doesn't feel that way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The morning walk. The book on the nightstand. The conversation 
                    you lean into instead of ending. These are the decisions that 
                    won't show up in any biography, but they're the ones that matter.
